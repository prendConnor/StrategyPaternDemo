This is an example of how to use strategy design pattern. It was used in a video
presentation for ECE141B (Spring 2020). The information that was covered in the
video are below.

Thanks for watching if you did, and I hope this example was helpful.


                        --Strategy Pattern--
Category: Behavioral

Description: When an object has member objects, use derived classes from a
common interface to allow the client to customize or change the functionality.

Purpose: Minimize an object’s reliance on any other single object and follow the
Open-Closed Principle (OCP).

Note: The OCP dictates that code should be written to be extended easily without
having to be changed. In other words, to add functionality, most of the work
should be done in extending what exists, not changing the structure and existing
functionality.

Use Case: When an object can be composed of many different types of a “class” of
objects (animals, tv brands, tire brands, etc), the strategy design pattern can
be used to greatly reduce the number of classes required to satisfy all possible
permutations of a problem.

Example: See code.
